# Code Refactor Starter Code

# Project Title 
"Horiseon Welcome Page Code Refactor"

# Description

The code for this website was initally setup with non-semantic HTML elements and overly extensive CSS styling.  Clients from the Horiseon company have asked that the code for the website be refactored.  Horiseon wants the code to follow accessiblity standards and be optimized for search engines.  

The index.html file has the following adjustments to the code:
- All div tags have been replaced with semantic tags.
- Comments have been added at the beginning and ending of each html semantic tag to designate sections of the welcome page.
- Each section element was assigned to a class attribute.
- Article tags were given id attribute to help with navigation of the welcome page.
- All images were given alt attributes for screen readers.
- More spacing and indentation was put in place for better reading of the new code.
- Title tag was added to head tag to describe the webpage.

The style.css file has the following adjustments to the code:
- Comments have been added at the beginning and ending of sections to designate what css styling corresponds with certain html tags.
Certain declarations were deleted from the original css code to consolidate style code and make the code easier to read and understand.
- Specificity was added to the css selectors for better understanding of what exactly is being styled.
- Id and Class selectors were used at much as possible to futher explain what is being styled.
